An online platform to sell the drawings, doodles and musings of disadvantaged children.
### Problem
Local community organisations (NGOs) working for children find accessing donors as challenging as dealing with their funding conditions. They have limited resource mobilization skills. There is a high dependency of donors and a tendency to shift interventions to match donor priorities rather than following their own vision.
Now, let’s look at the opportunities and strengths they have.
- They are local to the community, so they understand the need of the community better.
- They can provide long-term and locally sustainable solutions.
- They have local resource mobilisation and networking capacity.
### Solution
An online platform to sell the doodles and drawings by disadvantaged children. Possibly, other digital products extended from those doodles and drawings in future.
###### “Children can dream and they can doodle and draw.”
###### “Art is recreation for children, but at the same time it can become a valuable resource that can be mobilized for those little artist’s and their community welfare.”
###### “Digital products offer unique value as they are easy to produce and maintain as opposed to physical goods, and are highly scalable.”
###### “Same art can be used over and over again to generate funds.”
